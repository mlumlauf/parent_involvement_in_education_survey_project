# parent_involvement_in_education_survey_project

Project Title: 2019 NCES Parent and Family Involvement in Education (PFI) Survey Analysis

Language: Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Motivation and Notes:
  - This project was completed for DATA 11800 at the University of Chicago in Autumn 2022.
  - The project was inspired by the American Statistical Association's Fall Data Challenge (2022).
  - The curated dataset can be downloaded as a csv from http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~nicolae/118/PFI_2019.csv

Description:
  This project analyzes NCES survey data in order to determine possible correlation between parent and family
  involvement in education and student success (measured in student grades and enjoyment of school). In order
  to include analysis on households by federal poverty level, additional data was merged with the curated 
  dataset. This data can be found at https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines/prior-hhs-poverty-guidelines-federal-register-references/2019-poverty-guidelines.
  
Structure:
  The project includes a final report, the curated codebook, and the jupyter notebook with analysis. Exploratory 
  analysis was done in addition to the notebook, but the notebook contains only analysis included in the report.
